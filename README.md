# rss-aggregaitor

An RSS Aggregator in Go can be a simple program that fetches and processes RSS feeds from multiple sources. The program can periodically pull XML data from RSS URLs, parse it using a library like github.com/mmcdole/gofeed, and display or store the latest articles in a structured format. Features can include fetching feeds concurrently, filtering articles based on keywords, and saving results to a file or database for easy access. With Go's lightweight concurrency model, you can build an efficient and fast aggregator for personalized news or updates.
